# Modular Magnetic Robotic System for Multimodal Shape Transformation

## Overview

This repository documents the development of a **modular magnetic microrobotic system** capable of **multimodal structural transformation** using magnetic field-based actuation. The system is designed for high adaptability, aiming to outperform rigid robotic structures in flexibility, reconfiguration, and task-specific performance.

The work is being conducted as part of a Masterâ€™s project at Imperial College London (Department of Bioengineering), supervised by Dr. Dandan Zhang.

## Project Goals

* **Design modular microrobots** that can reconfigure into different shapes (e.g. chain, lattice).
* **Develop an electromagnetic control system** using Helmholtz coils to generate global uniform magnetic fields.
* **Demonstrate multimodal actuation**, enabling the robot to switch between locomotion and manipulation modes.
* **Implement open-loop control** to perform and evaluate transformations.
* **Validate system performance** using metrics such as transformation time, energy efficiency, and task adaptability.

## Key Features

* **Magnetic Actuation**: Combines magnetic torque and force to achieve both rotation and translation of modules.
* **Shape Transformation**: Enables the microrobot to dynamically switch between multiple configurations under external field control.
* **Swarm Coordination**: Explores basic coordination of multiple microrobot units using shared fields and physical design cues.
* **Simulation + Prototyping**: CAD modeling and magnetic field simulation precede physical testing with 3D-printed prototypes.

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress**

* Literature review, CAD design, and early simulations completed
